* Fixing Problems: Git is hard, and screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about in order to fix your problem. Here are resources to help figure out what to do when things go wrong.
